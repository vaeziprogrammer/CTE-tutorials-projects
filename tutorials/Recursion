-- Recursion in CTEs

Select *
from employees;


-- Step 1: Base case: Get the top-level employee (who has no boss)
-- Top-level employee has level 0
-- This ensures we're selecting the CEO or top boss (who has no boss)
-- Step 2: Recursive case: Get employees who report to the bosses from the previous step
-- Increment hierarchy level for each employee below the top boss
-- Join to find employees reporting to the previous level's boss

With recursive company_hierarchy as (
select employee_id, first_name, last_name, boss_id,
0 as hierarchy_level 
from employees
where boss_id is null 

union all

select e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.boss_id, hierarchy_level + 1 
from employees e, company_hierarchy ch
where e.boss_id = ch.employee_id 
)

-- Final selection: Get the hierarchy with employee and their boss names
SELECT ch.first_name Employee_First_Name, ch.last_name Employee_Last_Name,
       e.first_name Boss_First_Name, e.last_name Boss_Last_Name,
       hierarchy_level
FROM company_hierarchy ch
JOIN employees e
ON ch.boss_id = e.employee_id;
